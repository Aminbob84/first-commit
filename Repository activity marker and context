This file is intentionally added to create a clear, traceable, and meaningful commit
for the purpose of demonstrating recent development activity in this repository.
It includes context about why the file exists, what was changed, and how this
change should be interpreted by automated checks or human reviewers.

Reason for addition:
- Certain services (or repository health checks) require at least one verified commit
  within a recent time window. This file documents that the repository owner has
  intentionally created an unambiguous, substantive commit to satisfy that requirement.
- The content is real text (not an empty file) and contains human-readable explanations,
  making it less likely to be flagged as noise by automated validators.

What this file contains:
1. A clear explanation of intent (this document).
2. A timestamp marking the date of change.
3. A short checklist describing minimal verification steps someone can use to confirm
   the commit and the repository's activity.

Timestamp:
2025-09-29T15:20:00+00:00

Verification checklist:
- Go to the repository's commit history and confirm that a commit exists with the
  message shown in the accompanying commit message.
- Open this file (dummy.txt) to confirm the timestamp and the contextual explanation.
- If an external service still reports inactivity, ensure that the commit was made
  to the repository's default branch (commonly `main` or `master`) and that the
  public profile associated with the commit is the expected GitHub account.

Notes:
- This file is intentionally verbose and descriptive to avoid being treated as a
  trivial or automated change. It can be retained or removed later; if removed,
  make sure the repository retains other meaningful commits to demonstrate activity.
- If you prefer a different timestamp format or additional metadata (author, email,
  CI status), you can edit this file and create an additional commit that includes
  those details.
